# Working on your blog online

`medium-to-own-blog` provides a CMS to create/update/delete articles online, with a similar experience as Medium.

There are a couple of steps to set it up.

From your site dashboard on Netlify:

1. Go to Settings > Identity, and select Enable Identity service.
2. Under Registration preferences, select Invite only.
3. If you'd like to allow one-click login with services like Google and GitHub, check the boxes next to the services you'd like to use, under External providers.
4. Scroll down to Services > Git Gateway, and click Enable Git Gateway.

You can now head to your site and go to the `/admin` page. Once logged in, you will be able to edit your blog.
